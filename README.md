# Caltrack

Caltrack is an Android app developed by Group 5 of CSCI3660-D1 Fall 2024 Dr. Porter at UNG Dahlonega. This app is a calorie tracking app that allows users to create food logs for each day that they access the application. These food logs are then added up to reach a "goal", a predefined number of calories, proteins, and fats that the user is striving to reach every day.
